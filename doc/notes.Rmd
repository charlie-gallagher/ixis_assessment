There are two parts to the assessment: a SQL test and a retailer deliverable. The deliverable is the larger of the two projects, but it shouldn't take too long. Some preparatory steps: 

1. Review SQL notes, do some exercises beforehand (30-45 minutes)
2. Read and thoroughly understand assignment (15 minutes)
3. Read documentation for `openxlsx`, play around with it (30 minutes)
4. Set up git repo and R project (15 minutes)

That's the first hour and a half or so. The rest can be devoted to looking through the data, cleaning as necessary, clarifying any acronyms, etc., and of course producing the tables. 

Added all the documents I need to the `./doc` folder and set up a git repo. 


# `openxlsx` 
I haven't used this before, but it's a surprisingly flexible program. Let's make some tables and compare the results. First, here's the cart data. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openxlsx)
cart <- read_csv('data/DataAnalyst_Ecom_data_addsToCart.csv')
cart
```

Writing this to a simple `.xlsx`: 

```{r}
write.xlsx(cart, file = "test.xlsx", asTable = TRUE)
```

This looks like this: 

![table](..\img\tab1.jpg)

This puts it into table format, which is a more useful format than raw data for those using Excel. 

The simplest way to write multiple worksheets is to use a list of data frames. The names of the list elements become the names of the sheets. 

```{r}
l <- list("cart1" = cart, "cart2" = cart)

write.xlsx(l, file = "test.xlsx", asTable = TRUE)
```

![tabs](..\img\tab2.jpg)

This is naturally convenient. For more precise control, there are the workbook and worksheet objects. 

```{r}
ws <- createWorkbook()                # Create workbook object
addWorksheet(ws, sheetName = "cart1") # Initialize sheet 1
addWorksheet(ws, sheetName = "cart2") # Initialize sheet 2

writeDataTable(ws, cart, sheet = 1, colNames = TRUE, rowNames = FALSE)
writeDataTable(ws, cart, sheet = 2, colNames = TRUE, rowNames = FALSE)

saveWorkbook(ws, "test.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
```

In this case, the result is the same. However, you have many, many options for customization. Most of these are irrelevant for this assignment, so I'll stick with the basics.
