There are two parts to the assessment: a SQL test and a retailer deliverable. The deliverable is the larger of the two projects, but it shouldn't take too long. Some preparatory steps: 

1. Review SQL notes, do some exercises beforehand (30-45 minutes)
2. Read and thoroughly understand assignment (15 minutes)
3. Read documentation for `openxlsx`, play around with it (30 minutes)
4. Set up git repo and R project (15 minutes)

That's the first hour and a half or so. The rest can be devoted to looking through the data, cleaning as necessary, clarifying any acronyms, etc., and of course producing the tables. 

Added all the documents I need to the `./doc` folder and set up a git repo. 


# `openxlsx` 
I haven't used this before, but it's a surprisingly flexible program.
