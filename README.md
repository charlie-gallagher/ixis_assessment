# Overview
**Name:** Charlie Gallagher

**Position:** Data Analyst


## Organization
There are four folders: `data`, `img`, `r`, and `doc`. These are fairly self-explanatory: there's data in `data`, images in `img`, R files in `r`, and documentation in `doc`.

The final powerpoint is in the main folder. The Excel tables are in the `data` folder.

### R
I did an initial data exploration, which you can read if you're interested in the RMarkdown file `first_look.Rmd`. This file contains most of my thoughts as I got familiar with the data and worked through the assessment. The other two files in this folder are `excel.R` and `graphics.R`. They are responsible for creating the Excel file and making the graphics, respectively.

### Data
The data folder contains the two original CSV files, the excel file containing the tables, and `ixis.RData`, which is an R data file containing all the datasets used to make the Excel spreadsheets and the graphics. `ixis.RData` and `ixis_assessment_table.xlsx` are automatically generated in the file `r/excel.R`.


## Final Notes
I spent around 8 hours working on this assessment. It breaks down into something like this:

- 1 hour for getting organized, reading assessment and `openxlsx` documentation
- 2.5 hours for exploring the data, making both required datasets and non-required ones
- 2.5 hours for making a PowerPoint and deciding on/making final graphics
- 2 hours for cleaning up, documenting, etc.
